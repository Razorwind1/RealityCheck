<p>Combat in this game is meant to be fluid and flexible. Players are encouraged to simply say what they want to do rather than using the terminology of the game's mechanics.
</p><p>There is no "turn order" in this game, characters act how they wish when they see fit. However, there are rounds of combat to keep track of time and moderate how much one character can do in this time frame. Mechanically, this means that each character has a certain amount of Energy that they can spend on Actions each round. There are three types of Actions that represent the amount of time and energy required to perform the task:
</p><p><strong>Standard Action </strong> (~2 sec) - <strong>4 Energy</strong>
</p><p><strong>Swift Action </strong> (~1 sec) - <strong>2 Energy</strong>
</p><p><strong>Instant Action </strong> (~.5 sec) - <strong>1 Energy</strong>
</p><p><strong>Energy</strong> is what you use to perform Actions. Each character gets 7 Energy to use each round. Energy does not carry over to other rounds but is refreshed each round. You may get less Energy if your Stamina is low.
</p><p><strong>Stamina</strong> is your ability to do more in a shorter period of time. It's your reserves of energy. You can use up to 1 Stamina per round to perform Actions just like with Energy! (So by spending a Stamina and your 7 Energy, you could perform 2 Standard Actions on your turn.) Unlike Energy, Stamina is not regained each round, but only after a Short Rest. This means in a fight you may spend the first few rounds by using your Stamina to perform extra Actions, but eventually tire and fight slower.
</p><p class="pIndent"><strong>Maximum Stamina:</strong> Constitution Score (or 10) + 1/3 level
</p>
<!--<p>
	<ul class="pList">You can lose Energy if your Stamina gets too low:
		<li><strong>0 Stamina</strong> = unconscious</li>
		<li><strong>1 Stamina</strong> = 1 Energy per round</li>
		<li><strong>2 Stamina</strong> = 2 Energy per round</li>
		<li><strong>3 Stamina</strong> = 3 Energy per round</li>
		<li><strong>4 Stamina</strong> = 4 Energy per round</li>
		<li><strong>5 Stamina</strong> = 5 Energy per round</li>
		<li><strong>6 Stamina</strong> = 6 Energy per round</li>
		<li><strong>7 Stamina & above</strong> = 7 Energy per round</li>
	</ul>
</p> -->
<p>At the beginning of each round, you gain Energy based on your Stamina:

<p>Negative Stamina does not exist. If you are supposed to lose more Stamina than you have, you simply drop to (or stay at) zero.
</p><p>You may spend a Standard Action to regain 1 Stamina.
</p><p>Whenever a target falls unconscious, their Stamina falls to 0. Upon awaking, they gain 1 Stamina.
</p><p>Tip: Keep track of Stamina and Energy using some sort of token, since they can go up and down a lot very quickly.
</p>
<h2>
<span>Rounds</span>
</h2>
<p>A Round begins at the start of combat. Once every creature in the combat has done what they want to with their Energy, the Round ends. At that point, a new Round begins, everyone regains their Energy, and the cycle continues until the end of combat. (Rounds represent approximately 3-4 seconds)
</p><p>If creatures delay using their Energy, the DM may end the Round before their Energy is spent.
</p>
<h2>
<span>Initiative</span>
</h2>
<p>Initiative is a Wisdom based skill which may allow you to act before your opponent.
</p><p>Once a creature takes any Action, you may perform an Action before their next Action without requiring an Initiative Check. 
</p><p>To respond to a creature's movement while their Action has not completed, you must make an Initiative Check. If you succeed, you may perform your reaction any time after the creature has moved 1m. If you fail, you must wait until the creature's movement Action is completed to respond to it.
</p><p>You may also make an initiative check to draw a side arm at any time, even during an opponent's attack. (still takes a Swift Action)
</p><p>If someone attacks you, you may NOT roll an Initiative Check to attack them first.
</p><p>Your Initiative Check has a DC of the opposing creature's Initiative Check. (Whoever's is higher succeeds, with ties going to the one making the Check)
</p><p>You may only make one initiative check per round. If another situation arises that requires you to make one, you automatically fail.
</p><p>
</p>
<h2>
    <span>Actions</span>
</h2>
<p>List of Actions:
</p>
<div class="hangingIndent">
    <p><strong>Run:</strong> Move your Speed as a Standard Movement Action. 
    </p><p><strong>Quick Run:</strong> Move half your Speed (rounded down) as a Swift Movement Action.
    </p><p><strong>Shift:</strong> Move 1m as an Instant Action.
    </p><p><strong>Sprint:</strong> Move extra movement (see Lower Body Strength) during a Run Action. Costs 1 Stamina.
    </p><p><strong>Jump:</strong> Move your Jump Distance as a Standard Movement Action. Or, you move vertically by your Jump Reach as a Standard Movement Action. You spend 1 Stamina. You may choose to spend an additional Stamina and roll a LBS check to increase the distance covered (see LBS). If you use the Sprint Action immediately before a jump, you gain +2m to the distance covered.
</p><p><strong>Drop Down:</strong> You may drop to a crouch or onto your stomach as an Instant Movement Action.
</p><p><strong>Crawl:</strong> You can crawl at half your Speed as a Standard Movement Action (round down), or a quarter of your Speed (round down) as a Swift Movement Action. While crawling, you are considered Prone (disadvantage on EC and Attack Rolls) and provoke Opportunity Attacks.
</p><p><strong>Stand Up From Prone:</strong> As a Swift Movement Action, you may attempt to stand up, but you provoke Opportunity Attacks, and if one hits, you fail to stand (while standing up you still have disadvantage to EC). You may also stand up as a Standard Movement Action and provoke Opportunity Attacks, but you still stand even if an attack hits.
</p><p><strong>Turn Around:</strong> Turning completely around is an Instant Movement Action. You can also turn around during a Movement Action by sacrificing 1m of movement.
</p><p><strong>Defend:</strong> As a Swift Action, you may ready yourself to be attacked. You gain +1 to all of your Defenses, and an extra +1 (for a total of +2) to your EC if using a shield. This defense bonus lasts until you make an attack, cast a spell, or move more than your Speed during a Round.
</p><p><strong>Stow an Item:</strong> If the item is a side arm (or otherwise easy to stow), you may stow it as a Swift Action. Otherwise, it requires a Standard Action to stow an item.
</p><p><strong>Equip an Item:</strong> If the item is a side arm (or otherwise quickly accessible), you may equip it as a Swift Action. If it is something slung on your back or in a hard to reach place (like a bag of holding), it is a Standard Action. If the item is inside a backpack that needs to be removed and opened to extract the item, it is a Full Round Action. (This does not provoke Opportunity Attacks)
</p><p><strong>Pick Up an Item:</strong> Picking up an item from the ground is a Swift Action that provokes Opportunity Attacks.
</p><p><strong>Melee Attack:</strong> As a Standard Attack Action you may attack a target within your Reach with a melee weapon. (see Attacking)
</p><p><strong>Ranged Attack:</strong> As a Standard Attack Action you may attack a target within your Range with a ranged weapon. (see Attacking)
</p><p><strong>Opportunity Attack:</strong> If you provoke an Opportunity Attack from an opponent, it means they can attack you while you are performing the action (no Initiative Check required), and you have Disadvantage on EC but they must have the Energy required for the attack! (see the Opportunity Attack section below)
</p>
</div>
<p>When making any type of Movement Action, whenever you turn sharply (more than 45deg) you sacrifice 1m of movement.
</p>
<h2>
    <span>Attacking</span>
</h2>
<p>When you attack, you use your Attack Value (AV). You have different AV's for different types of attacks. 
</p><p class="pIndent"><strong>Attack Value</strong>: 5 + Ranged/Melee Ability Score Attack Bonus + Weapon Attack Bonus
</p><p>Once an attack is made, the AV is compared against opponent's Defense Roll (usually EC).
</p>
<p class="pTitle">Every time you attack, you roll a make an <strong>Attack Roll</strong> (1d20):
</p>
<ul class="pList">
    <li>20 = Critical Hit (You automatically hit the target, ignore their armor, and they are Exposed until the end of the next Round)</li>
    <li>1-3 = You are Exposed until the end of the next Round</li>
    <li>1 = Your attack fails</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<h2>
    <span>Melee Combat</span>
</h2>
<p class="pIndent"><strong>Melee AV:</strong> 5 + MASAB + Weapon Attack Bonus
</p><p>Your Melee Ability Score Attack Bonus (MASAB) is added to the AV and Damage Rolls of melee weapons in which you are proficient. This bonus is calculated thus:
</p><p class="pIndent"><strong>MASAB:</strong> (Enhanced Strength Modifier + Enhanced Dexterity Modifier) / 3
</p><p>Some combat styles or feats may add another Enhanced Ability Modifier into this calculation (always inside the parentheses). You may never add the same ability to the equation twice (eg: if you take two combat styles that both allow you to add your Enhanced Charisma Modifier to your MASAB equation you would still only add your Enhanced Charisma Modifier to the equation once).
</p><p>If you hit the target (your AV is higher than their EC Roll) you then determine the Damage you deal:
</p><p class="pIndent"><strong>Damage:</strong> Weapon Damage + MASAB
</p><p>Once a target is hit, they determine whether you hit their armor. To do this, they add their Armor Coverage to their EC Roll. If your AV is lower than this total, you hit their armor, and they reduce the Damage they take by the Armor Bonus.
</p><p>If your AV is higher than the defender's EC Roll + AC, then the defender takes all the damage you dealt.
</p>
<h2>
    <span>Ranged Combat</span>
</h2>
<p>It is much easier to miss with a ranged attack than a melee attack (though if you are on target, it is very difficult for the target to dodge). With Ranged Attacks you have a chance to miss based on your skill and how far away a target is. Miss Chance is a value which your Attack Roll must meet or exceed in order to hit your target.
</p><p class="pIndent"><strong>Miss Chance:</strong> 15 + 1 per Range Category - Weapon Accuracy - Dexterity Modifier
</p><p>+5 Miss Chance if the target is Running or otherwise moving as fast or faster while you attack.
</p><p>-10 Miss Chance if the target is completely stationary.
</p><p>If you do not have Combat Proficiency with the weapon you are using, it's miss chance may be increased (DM discretion).
</p><p>If the target is 5m or closer, and you are Proficient in the weapon you are using, you hit even if your Attack Roll is lower than the Miss Chance.
</p><p><strong>Range Categories:</strong> 0m-10m, 11m-20m, 21m-30m and on in increments of 10. For every category beyond 0m-10m, your Miss Chance increases by 1.
</p><p>If the target of a Ranged Attack is not facing where the attack is coming from, they do not Roll EC, but are automatically hit if the attack is on target.
</p><p>If the target of a Ranged Attack IS facing the attack they may roll EC, but not count their weapon EC bonuses toward the roll (shield bonuses still apply).
</p><p>If your Attack hits but the Attack Roll is less than the Miss Chance + the target's AC, you hit the target's armor. If the Attack is greater than or equal to the Miss Chance AC, you ignore the target's armor.
</p><p>Miss Chance can also increase or decrease depending on the size of the target (DM discretion).

<p>Your upper body strength allows you to control a greater draw weight. The higher the draw weight of the weapon, the more range and damage it has. Thus, you want to choose the highest draw weight you can manage for your weapon.
</p><p>If you increase your Upper Body Strength and want to increase the draw weight of your weapon, you will either have to buy a new weapon, find someone who can adjust the draw weight (much cheaper than a new weapon), or attempt to adjust the weapon yourself using Craft(bow making).
</p><p>CROSSBOWS: Most crossbows have a stirrup that the user can put their foot through to draw with both hands, allowing for a greater draw weight than other bows. Therefore, any two-handed crossbow adds +10 to the Passive Upper Body Strength when determining Draw Weight (for a total of +20 Passive UBS).
</p>
<h2>
    <span>Defenses</span>
</h2>
<p><strong>Evasion Class</strong> (EC) is your ability to evade an attack.
</p><p class="pIndent"><strong>EC:</strong> 1/3 level + Dexterity Modifier
</p><p>If an attack doesn't specify a Defense to target, assume it is EC.
</p><p>When targeting EC, you may hit the target's armor, reducing the damage the target takes.
</p><p><strong>Fortitude:</strong> One's ability to endure some negative physical effects. (Eg: Fortitude Saves are often made to defend against Combat Maneuvers)
</p><p class="pIndent"><strong>Fortitude:</strong> 5 + 1/3 level + Constitution Modifier + Strength Modifier
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Will:</strong> One's determination and willpower which protects against mental and some physical attacks. (Eg: A Will Save is sometimes made to resist revealing information due to torture)
</p><p class="pIndent"><strong>Will:</strong> 5 + 1/3 Level + Charisma Modifier + Wisdom Modifier
</p><p>Some attacks just target Fortitude or Will, in which case armor doesn't affect the damage taken.
</p><p>Fortitude and Will Defense Rolls are sometimes called Saves.
</p><p><strong>Chance Roll:</strong> This is a roll of pure luck. By default, a 1-9 is a fail, and a 10-20 is a success. This may also be referred to as a Chance Save.
</p>
<h2>
    <span>Weaknesses and Resistances</span>
</h2>
<p>If you have Resistance to a certain type of damage, then you take half damage (rounding down).
</p><p>If you have a Weakness to a certain type of damage, then you take double damage.
</p><p>Weakness and Resistance cancel each other out just like Advantage and Disadvantage.
</p>
<h2>
    <span>Critical Hit</span>
</h2>
<p>When you roll a natural 20 on your attack roll, your attack hits no matter what. This is called a critical hit. Damage dealt by this weapon ignores armor and the target is Exposed.
</p>
<h2>
    <span>Facing</span>
</h2>
<p>You are always Facing half the area around you and not Facing the other half. On a hex grid you face the 3 hexes in front of you (not facing the 3 behind you). On a square grid you face the 3 squares in front of you and the 2 beside you (not facing the 3 behind you).
</p><p>If your back is turned from an opponent, you have Disadvantage on EC rolls to defend against attacks from them, and your Shield and Weapon bonuses to EC do not apply.
</p><p>Creatures can hide from you. (they cannot hide from you in front of you without cover/camouflage)
</p><p>Turning completely around is an Instant Movement Action. You can also turn around during a Movement Action by sacrificing 1m of movement.

    <span>Aura</span>
</h2>
<p>In this world, all living beings have an Aura. This aura protects them from harm. This is a part of the magic that saturates the world. Animals have weak auras, but the auras of sentient creatures tend to be very strong, protecting from all kinds of physical abuse from burns to hypothermia to an arrow in the knee.
</p><p>Once you have taken enough damage to reduce your Aura’s strength to 0, your body is affected normally by any harmful effects.
