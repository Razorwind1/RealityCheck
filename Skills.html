<p>The presented Skills represent levels of competence and expertise in general areas which are categorized to encompass many different capabilities. Your expertise at a particular task is determined by how high the relevant Skill Bonus is.
</p><p>Each Skill is associated with a certain Ability Score (see <a href="CharacterCreation.html#AbilityScores">Ability Scores</a>). You add the relevant Halved Ability Modifier to the Skill Bonus.
</p><p>Many tasks you attempt will require you to roll a <b>Skill Check</b>. This helps determine your degree of success at the task.
</p><p class="pIndent"><strong>Skill Check</strong> = 1d20 + Skill Bonus
</p><p class="pIndent"><strong>Skill Bonus</strong> = relevant Halved Ability Modifier + 1/3 Wisdom Modifier + Proficiency Bonus + Skill Ranks
</p><p><b>Optional Rule:</b> If you roll a natural 20 on a Skill Check you may gain +10 to the Check if you are Proficient in the Skill. If you roll a natural 1 on a Skill Check you may have a -10 to the Check if you are not Proficient in the Skill.
</p>
<h4 id="SkillProficiency">
<span>Skill Proficiency</span>
</h4>
<p>You can gain Skill Proficiencies in a number of ways, including spending Background Points or taking Feats and Themes. A Skill Proficiency represents your training, practice, or natural aptitude in a particular Skill.
</p><p>A Skill Proficiency grants +4 to the designated Skill. If you receive Proficiency in the same Skill for a second time for any reason, you gain +2 in that Skill. For each additional Proficiency in the same Skill, you gain +1 to that Skill.
</p>
<h4 id="SkillRanks">
<span>Skill Ranks</span>
</h4>
<p>Skill Ranks represent further study or practice of a Skill.
</p><p>Each Skill Rank is used to give +1 to a Skill.
</p><p>You may not assign more Ranks to a Skill than your Level + the relevant Halved Ability Modifier.
</p><p class="pIndent"><strong># of Skill Ranks</strong> = (5 + Halved Intelligence Modifier) × (1 + 1/3 Level)
</p><p>You gain Skill Ranks at first level and every 1/3 Level and when you do, you may re-assign your Skill Ranks if you desire.
</p><p>Some Skills have an asterisk (*) next to them. This means that you have -10 to the Skill if you are not Proficient in it.
</p>
<h4 id="1/3WisdomModifier">
<span>1/3 Wisdom Modifier</span>
</h4>
<p><i>Wisdom represents common sense and an intuitive knowledge of the world. When making Skill Checks, it is often helpful to think on your feet. You may not have any book knowledge of nature, but you could have experiences that help you understand how plants and animals work. You may have never studied religion, but have an intuitive insight into gods and their followers. When climbing up a cliff, you may have enough awareness and understanding of the situation to take the safest and quickest route even though your strength is lacking. Simply put, your wisdom can affect all your skillsets.</i>
</p><p>You add one third your Wisdom Modifier to every Skill (even if it is negative). Wisdom skills (Awareness, Initiative, and Insight) receive the normal Halved Wisdom Modifier plus this bonus.
</p>
<h4 id="SituationalModifiers">
<span>Situational Modifiers</span>
</h4>
<p>Situational modifiers are added or subtracted from Skill Checks based on the situation. The GM may add situational modifiers as they believe appropriate. When a situation not specified in the rules occurs that the GM believes merits a positive or negative bonus it is recommended that modifiers (+2, -3, +5, etc) are used instead of Advantage or Disadvantage. This way, any mechanics of feats or combat styles involving Advantage or Disadvantage are not negated because of the particular way a GM treats certain situation. The GM need not notify the player of these modifiers, though it is often a good idea to do so. This mechanic should be used to reward creative players more than to hinder their progress. Optionally, the GM and players agree, Situational Modifiers can also be applied in combat, even to attacks and defense.

<h2 id="UBS">
<span>Arm Strength (Str)</span>
</h2>
<p><i>Your ability to perform feats of strength with your upper body and the knowledge of and comfortability with your body that comes from relentless training.</i>
</p>
<h4>
<span>Lifting or pushing heavy objects</span>
</h4>
<p>Checks usually don’t have to be made to lift something heavy. It wouldn’t make sense for you to be able to lift the chest yesterday but not today. GMs will decide what makes sense for you to be able to lift based off of your Arm Strength.
</p>
<h4>
<span>Draw Weight</span>
</h4>
    <p>Higher Arm Strength allows you to manage higher Draw Weights (see <a href="Combat.html#DrawWeights">Draw Weight</a>).
</p>
<h4 id="ThrowingWeapons">
<span>Throwing Weapons</span>
</h4>
<p>Higher Arm Strength helps you throw weapons further. (see <a href="Combat.html#ThrowingWeapons">Throwing Weapons</a>)

<p class="pIndent"><i><b>Below are some tasks that can make use of both your Arm Strength and Leg Strength:</b></i>
</p>
<h4 id="Climb">
<span>Climb</span>
</h4>
<p>Arm Strength and Leg Strength are combined for Climb Checks (still one d20 rolled). Every Round in which you climb, you must make a Climb Check to see how fast you can climb. It takes you 3 Energy to climb this distance. Additionally, you must spend 1 Stamina (regardless of whether or not you successfully move). Depending on how precarious your situation is, you may have to make a Climb Check simply to not fall.

<h4 id="EscapeHold">
<span>Escape Hold</span>
</h4>
<p>If you are Restrained by another creature, you may try to escape by spending 3 Energy and making an Arm Strength Check, Leg Strength Check, or Fortitude Save with a DC of their Arm Strength Check or Fortitude Save to try to escape.
</p>
<h4 id="BreakingDown">
<span>Breaking Down a Door or Wall</span>
</h4>
<p>As a general guideline, an old or poorly made wooden door is pretty easy to break down with a DC of around 20 while a thick stone door could be 50 or more. 
</p><p>Breaking down a door or wall takes 2 Energy and 1 Stamina and requires an UBS or LBS Check. This can be repeated several times (if you fail on the first Checks). 
</p><p>Charging into the structure by Running or Sprinting towards it immediately before the Check from at least 3m away adds +5 to the Check. If the door/target is large enough, multiple people may be able to help on the check. In this case, only one d20 is rolled, but all character’s UBS or LBS modifiers are added (if they are charging, the +5 bonuses also stack).

<p>There are often more detailed nuances involved in influencing others, which are reflected with situational modifiers. For instance, the merchant could be very susceptible to flattery in which case when you try flattering him (which would most likely use Inspire), you may get a situational bonus of +5 or +10.
</p><p>Now let’s say the you convince the merchant to let you hitch a ride. Once you get to the next town, you could try to persuade the merchant to provide you with a place to stay and some food and drink. In this case, your probability of success would be largely contingent on the merchant’s perception of you during the ride there. If you intimidated the merchant into giving you a ride, they would likely be very resistant to helping you further. If you struck up a conversation on the way and the merchant enjoyed your company, he may be happy to provide for you for a night. (To determine how the merchant feels about you after the ride without role-playing it out, the GM may have you Roll several different Charisma-based Checks such as Inspire, Reason, Discourage, Deceive, and Social Sense.)
</p><p><b>GM Note: </b>Don't get too hung up on the numbers. Reward good role-playing with situational modifiers and allow your players to use the Charisma Skill they think best reflects their character's argument (within reason).

<span>Intimidate (Cha)</span>
</h2>
<p><i>Your ability to browbeat someone to do what you want and to frighten your opponents. </i>
</p><p>Intimidation is a Charisma based skill because there are times when all it takes are a few well-placed words to make someone feel scared. However, there are also times when throwing a table across the room is intimidating, but has nothing to do with your Charisma. Thus, if appropriate, you can use your Halved Strength Modifier instead of Halved Charisma Modifier when making an Intimidate Check.
</p><p>Intimidate tends to be very likely to give situational modifiers. Drawing a weapon on a defenseless creature or physically harming the target can greatly improve your odds of success compared to a passive intimidation. However, the target will also probably hate you more, the more aggressive your intimidation.
</p><p>You can attempt to intimidate a creature as a part of any action. However, to give the creature a disadvantage in combat, you must use 3 Energy as an Immediate Interrupt or 2 Energy as a part of another, possibly intimidating, action to target a single creature. That creature makes a Will roll with a DC of your Intimidate Check -5 per Tier. If they fail, they are Shaken until the end of the Round.
</p><p>If you try to Intimidate a creature and fail, they cannot be Intimidated by you for the rest of the Round. Additionally, they have Advantage on any Will rolls to avoid your Intimidation until your next or their next Short Rest or until you manage to successfully Intimidate them.
</p><p><b>GM Note:</b> The GM may have you make Intimidate Checks for free during combat to determine how frightening you are, but these Checks should either be very rare or function not make enemies Shaken.
</p><p><b>Imagery Note:</b> A failed Intimidate Check doesn’t mean the target isn’t scared (they can still be very afraid and act accordingly). It simply means they didn’t do what the Intimidator wanted and/or they don’t receive any combat disadvantages for being intimidated.

<p>If your Deceive Check is higher than the contesting Insight Check, then the Deceive Check succeeds (meaning the person believes you are telling the truth). Otherwise it fails and they think you are lying (or think you are not who you appear to be).
</p><p>Deceive Checks are typically made once per conversation, if it is short. In the case of long term deceit such as a disguise, a Deceive Check is made every hour that someone is paying attention to the deceiver. Once the same person has been deceived by the same thing three consecutive times, Deceive checks are no longer necessary to actively deceive them. This is assuming there is no event that calls into question the truthfulness of the deceiver. For every such event, another Deceive Check and corresponding Insight Checks should be made.

    <dd>&#9671; <b>Friendly:</b> The animal is willing to interact with the target and may cooperate with it. However, the animal doesn’t have a strong bond with the target and would still place its own inclinations over the well-being of the target, meaning you can’t expect a friendly creature to protect you from harm or not steel your food.</dd>

<p>The attitude change produced with a Handle Animal Check lasts at least until the end of the next Round or until the animal is influenced by someone/something else. It is up to the DM to determine if the animal’s disposition lends itself to staying Friendly or Helpful to you for an extended period of time. An animal is unlikely to go from Indifferent to Unfriendly without being influenced negatively towards you.
</p><p>Rolling a natural 1 on a Handle Animal Check to try to improve the attitude of an animal reduces the Attitude of the creature by one level.
</p><p>Most Handle Animal Checks are made using 3 Energy and can be attempted again after a failed attempt.

<p>Some animals are instinctively stubborn or instinctively willing to be influenced whether because of their born nature, their past, or their current situation and DMs should take this into account.
</p><p>You can also use Handle Animal to teach a creature tricks and give it commands. (specific rules still to come)
</p>

<h2 id="Knowledge">
<span>Knowledge*</span>
</h2>
<p><i>The knowledge you’ve accumulated during your life, unique talents, and occupational skills.</i>
</p><p>Knowledge Skills (or Knowledges) work differently from other Skills. You have multiple Knowledge Skills and each one is chosen by you, based on your character’s backstory and unique skills. At level 1, every character gains 3 Knowledge Proficiencies for free (plus at least 2 more from Themes). You also gain an additional Knowledges equal to 1/3 your Intelligence Modifier, but don’t lose any Knowledges if this is negative.
</p><p>Knowledge Skills are distinct from other Skills. They are not associated with an Ability Score and have unique rules.
</p><p>Each Knowledge can have up to 3 tiers with each tier getting progressively narrower. For instance, you could have a Knowledge that looked like this: Religion &#10132; The Atlean Pantheon &#10132; Pelor. When rolling for something that is second-tier (The Atlean Pantheon), you may roll twice and use the better result. When rolling for something that is third tier (Pelor), you may roll three times and use the better result. This tiered nature of Knowledge Skills represents how people tend to specialize in one area but still have some knowledge of related fields.
</p><p>If you ever gain Advantage on a Knowledge Check, you roll the die one additional time and choose to use that result instead. With Disadvantage, you roll one less time (unless it is your most broad area, in which case Disadvantage works normally).
</p><p>The GM can approve or disapprove different Knowledges.
</p><p>When you become Proficient in a Knowledge Skill for the first time, you don’t gain a bonus to it, you simply are able to roll that Knowledge. Without Proficiency in a Knowledge, you cannot initiate a roll based on it. The GM may still let you roll, but with a penalty to the Check. For each additional Proficiency you gain in a Knowledge Skill, you gain +5 to the Skill, up to +10 (with triple Proficiency in a Knowledge).
</p><p>When trying to determine if you know something with a Knowledge Check, the following are the guidelines for the DC: Basic knowledge is DC: 10, uncommon knowledge is DC: 15, niche knowledge is DC: 20, and obscure knowledge is DC: 25, and hidden knowledge is DC: 30.
</p><p>When trying to determine how well you craft an item, the following are the guidelines for the DC: Barely passable is DC: 10, decent quality is DC: 15, above average is DC: 20, expert quality is DC: 25, and masterwork is DC: 30.
</p><p>When trying to determine how well you perform, such as performing a piece of music, the following are the guidelines for the DC: Some noticeable mistakes is DC: 10, only a few mistakes is DC: 15, no noticeable mistakes is DC: 20, expert performance is DC: 25, and awe-inspiring performance is DC: 30.

<p>Your character is assumed to have very basic knowledge aside from their Knowledge Skills, such as knowledge of their body, and thus their race and knowledge of their personal life and family. They also may be knowledgeable about the basics of other Skills they are Proficient in (knowledge of how to tread lightly if Proficient in Stealth, or knowledge of how to observe people Proficient in Insight) and the basics of Spell Proficiencies they have (knowledge of potion recipes if Proficient in Potions, or knowledge of types of wood if Proficient in Wood magic).
