<p>The presented Skills represent levels of competence and expertise in general areas which are categorized to encompass many different capabilities. Your expertise at a particular task is determined by how high the relevant Skill Bonus is.
</p><p>Each Skill is assigned to a certain Ability Score (see <a href="CharacterCreation.html#AbilityScores">Ability Scores</a>). You add the relevant Halved Ability Modifier to the Skill Bonus.
</p><p>Many tasks you attempt will require you to roll a <b>Skill Check</b>. This determines your level of success at the task.
</p><p class="pIndent"><strong>Skill Check</strong> = 1d20 + Skill Bonus
</p><p class="pIndent"><strong>Skill Bonus</strong> = relevant Halved Ability Modifier + 1/3 Wisdom Modifier + Proficiency Bonus + Skill Ranks
</p><p>If you roll a natural 20 on a Skill Check you gain +10 to the Check if you are Proficient in the Skill. If you roll a natural 1 on a Skill Check you have a -10 to the Check if you are not Proficient in the Skill.
</p>
<h4 id="SkillProficiency">
<span>Skill Proficiency</span>
</h4>
<p>You can gain Skill Proficiency by spending Background Points or taking Feats and Themes. Skill Proficiency represents your training, practice, or natural aptitude in a particular Skill.
</p><p>A Skill Proficiency grants +4 to the designated Skill. If you receive Proficiency in the same Skill for a second time for any reason, you gain +2 in that Skill. For each additional Proficiency in the same Skill, you gain +1 to that Skill.
</p>
<h4 id="SkillRanks">
<span>Skill Ranks</span>
</h4>
<p>Skill Ranks represent further study or practice of a Skill.
</p><p>Each Skill Rank may be used to give +1 to a Skill.
</p><p>You may not assign more Ranks to a Skill than your Level.
</p><p class="pIndent"><strong># of Skill Ranks</strong> = (4 + Halved Intelligence Modifier) × Level
</p><p>Every Level you may re-assign your Skill Ranks if you desire.
</p><p>Some Skills have an asterisk (*) next to them. This means that you have -10 to the Skill if you are not Proficient in it.
</p>
<h4 id="1/3WisdomModifier">
<span>1/3 Wisdom Modifier</span>
</h4>
<p><i>Wisdom represents common sense and an intuitive knowledge of the world. When making Skill Checks, it is often helpful to think on your feet. You may not have any book knowledge of nature, but you could have experiences that help you understand how plants and animals work. You may have never studied religion, but have an intuitive insight into gods and their followers. When climbing up a cliff, you may have enough awareness and understanding of the situation to take the safest and quickest route even though your strength is lacking. Simply put, your wisdom can affect every Skill.</i>
</p><p>You add one third your Wisdom Modifier to every Skill (even if it is negative). Wisdom skills such as Awareness, Heal, and Insight receive the normal Halved Wisdom Modifier plus this bonus.
</p>
<h4 id="SituationalModifiers">
<span>Situational Modifiers</span>
</h4>
<p>Situational modifiers are added or subtracted from Skill Checks based on the situation. The DM may add situational modifiers as they believe appropriate. When a situation not specified in the rules occurs that the DM believes merits a positive or negative bonus it is recommended that modifiers (+2, -3, +5, etc) are used instead of Advantage or Disadvantage. This way, any mechanics of feats or combat styles involving Advantage or Disadvantage are not negated because of the particular way a DM treats certain situation. The DM need not notify the players when they use these modifiers, though it is often a good idea to do so.
</p>

<h2 id="UBS">
<span>Upper Body Strength (Str)</span>
</h2>
<p><i>Your ability to perform feats of strength with your upper body and the knowledge of and comfortability with your body that comes from relentless training.</i>
</p>
<h4>
<span>Lifting or pushing heavy objects</span>
</h4>
<p>Checks usually don’t have to be made to lift something heavy. It wouldn’t make sense for you to be able to lift the chest yesterday but not today. DMs will decide what makes sense for you to be able to lift based off of your UBS.
</p>
<h4>
<span>Draw Weight</span>
</h4>
    <p>Higher UBS allows you to manage higher Draw Weights (see <a href="Combat.html#RangedAttacks">Ranged Attacks</a>).
</p>
<h4 id="ThrowingWeapons">
<span>Throwing Weapons</span>
</h4>
<p>Throwing a weapon is a Ranged Attack. (see <a href="Combat.html#RangedAttacks">Ranged Attacks</a>)
</p><p>Throwing a weapon is a ranged attack. Weapons without the Thrown property deal half damage when thrown unless the Hit roll is a natural 20 in which case they deal full damage. Weapons with the Thrown property have Accuracy equal to their AV bonus (meaning their AV bonus helps with throwing as well). Unless otherwise specified, Light weapons have a throwing range of (3/5/10), Heavy weapons have a throwing range of (1/3/6), and other weapons have a throwing range of (2/4/8).
</p><p class="pIndent"><strong>Thrown(#/#/#):</strong> The 3 numbers in parenthesis are typical ranged values indicating Advantage and Disadvantage on the Hit roll. For example: Thrown(5/10/20) would mean if the target is 5m or closer, you have Advantage on the Hit roll; if the target is over 10m away, you have Disadvantage on your Hit roll; and 20m is the maximum range the weapon can be thrown in which you can hope to be accurate. (see <a href="Items.html#WeaponProperties">Weapon Properties</a>)
</p><p>If you have high Upper Body Strength, then you can throw things further:

<p><b>Note:</b> If you lose your grip due to a failed Climb Check, you will likely still have a chance to catch yourself before you fall completely.
</p><p><b>Note:</b> Attempting to move as a Climb always takes 3 Energy even if you make no progress.
</p>
<h4 id="EscapeHold">
<span>Escape Hold</span>
</h4>
<p>If you are Held by another creature, you may try to escape by spending 3 Energy and making an UBS Check, LBS Check, or Fortitude roll with a DC of their UBS Check or Fortitude roll to try to escape.
</p>
<h4 id="BreakingDown">
<span>Breaking Down a Door or Wall</span>
</h4>
<p>As a general guideline, an old or poorly made wooden door is pretty easy to break down with a DC of around 20 while a thick stone door could be 50 or more. 
</p><p>Breaking down a door or wall takes 2 Energy and 1 Stamina and requires an UBS or LBS Check. This can be repeated several times (if you fail on the first Checks). 
</p><p>Charging into the structure by Running or Sprinting towards it immediately before the Check from at least 3m away adds +5 to the Check. If the door/target is large enough, multiple people may be able to help on the check. In this case, only one d20 is rolled, but all character’s UBS or LBS modifiers are added (if they are charging, the +5 bonuses also stack).

</p><p>Sleight Of Hand can also be used to attempt escape from bonds. A single Check takes about a minute. If you fail, you may spend another minute to add +1 to the check. You may do this up to 10 times for +10 to the check. You may not try to escape the same bonds with a second Check under the same circumstances. This works much like Disable Device and the DCs are similar. Keep in mind that the knot used to tie the bonds as well as the tightness of them is very important for determining how difficult the bonds are to escape.

<p>There are often more detailed nuances involved in influencing others, which are reflected with situational modifiers. For instance, the merchant could be very susceptible to flattery in which case when you try flattering him (which would most likely use Inspire), you may get a situational bonus of +5 or +10.
</p><p>Now let’s say the you convince the merchant to let you hitch a ride. Once you get to the next town, you could try to persuade the merchant to provide you with a place to stay and some food and drink. In this case, your probability of success would be largely contingent on the merchant’s perception of you during the ride there. If you intimidated the merchant into giving you a ride, they would likely be very resistant to helping you further. If you struck up a conversation on the way and the merchant enjoyed your company, he may be happy to provide for you for a night. (To determine how the merchant feels about you after the ride without role-playing it out, the DM may have you roll several different Charisma-based Checks such as Inspire, Reason, Discourage, Deceive, and Social Sense.)
</p><p>The key to interpersonal interaction in this game is good role-playing. The job of the DM is to make things make sense when the numbers don’t cut it.
</p><p><b>Note:</b> Reason, Inspire, and Discourage checks become more difficult when dealing with low-intelligence creatures (say, 5 or lower). In fact, against no/low sentience creatures (animals), these skills are no longer effective.
</p>
<h2 id="Reason">
<span>Reason(Cha)</span>
</h2>
<p><i>Your skill at logical thinking and ability to convince someone to do something by reasoning with them.</i>
</p><p>Reason is the primary Skill used in formal debating. It is often the best way to convince highly intelligent or cautious people to do something.

<h2 id="Inspire">
<span>Inspire(Cha)</span>

</p><p>High Inspire Checks will move hearts and make people want to act!
</p>
<h4 id="Performing">
<span>Performing</span>
</h4>
<p>Inspire also acts as a perform Check. It will help you make an impactful performance, whether with a musical instrument to move a crowd, an epic poem to impress the nobility, or a theater performance to make some coin. This skill determines the performance aspect of these things, not if you have musical talent or acting skill (which is determined by your Talent Proficiencies).
</p><p>The Discourage Skill could also be used to determine the quality of a performance depending on how you are trying to influence the audience.
</p>
<dl class="smallList">
<dt>Some things you can make an Inspire Check to do…</dt>
    <dd>&#9671; Convince a civilian to support your noble cause</dd>
    <dd>&#9671; Encourage a shy boy to stand up for themselves</dd>
    <dd>&#9671; Give a rousing speech that excites the crowd</dd>
</dl>
<h2 id="Discourage">
<span>Discourage(Cha)</span>
</h2>
<p><i>Your ability to make people feel guilt, sadness, sympathy, and generally negative emotions.</i>
</p><p>High Discourage Checks will dampen spirits or make tempers flare!
</p>
<dl class="smallList">
<dt>Some things you can make a Discourage Check to do…</dt>
    <dd>&#9671; Make a sad story you tell particularly touching</dd>
    <dd>&#9671; Cleverly insult your enemy to annoy and infuriate them</dd>
    <dd>&#9671; Make someone feel sorry for or pity you</dd>
    <dd>&#9671; Reveal to someone their inadequacies and shortcomings</dd>
    <dd>&#9671; Get someone do something by telling them they can't</dd>
</dl>
<p><b>Note:</b> A character who can use both Discourage and Inspire can be quite powerful. They may make someone feel guilty before inspiring them to the right choice. They may make a crowd depressed before showing them the path to action! DMs should be aware that using two Charisma Skills is more powerful than one!
</p>
<h2 id="Intimidate">
<span>Intimidate(Cha)</span>
</h2>
<p><i>Your ability to browbeat someone to do what you want and to frighten your opponents. </i>
</p><p>Intimidation is a Charisma based skill because there are times when all it takes are a few well-placed words to make someone feel scared. However, there are also times when throwing a table across the room is intimidating, but has nothing to do with your Charisma. Thus, if appropriate, you can use your Halved Strength Modifier instead of Halved Charisma Modifier when making an Intimidate Check.
</p><p>Intimidate tends to be very likely to give situational modifiers. Drawing a weapon on a defenseless creature or physically harming the target can greatly improve your odds of success compared to a passive intimidation. However, the target will also probably hate you more, the more aggressive your intimidation.
</p><p>You can attempt to intimidate a creature as a part of any action. However, to give the creature a disadvantage in combat, you must use 3 Energy as an Immediate Interrupt or 2 Energy as a part of another, possibly intimidating, action to target a single creature. That creature makes a Will roll with a DC of your Intimidate Check -5 per Tier. If they fail, they are Shaken until the end of the Round.
</p><p>If you try to Intimidate a creature and fail, they cannot be Intimidated by you for the rest of the Round. Additionally, they have Advantage on any Will rolls to avoid your Intimidation until your next or their next Short Rest or until you manage to successfully Intimidate them.
</p><p><b>Note:</b> The DM may have you make Intimidate Checks for free during combat to determine how frightening you are, but these Checks will not make the targets Shaken or suffer other disadvantages due to your abilities.
</p><p><b>Note:</b> A failed Intimidate Check doesn’t mean the target isn’t scared (they can still be very afraid and act accordingly). It simply means they didn’t do what the Intimidator wanted and/or they don’t receive any combat disadvantages for being intimidated.
</p>

<h2 id="Deceive">
<span>Deceive(Cha)</span>
</h2>
<p><i>Your ability to tell a convincing lie, hide your thoughts and feelings from others, and act convincingly like someone you are impersonating.</i>
</p><p>You make a Deceive Check when you are actively deceiving (lying, avoiding the truth, or in disguise). Your Deceive Bonus can also help you defend against Insight Checks (see <a href="#Insight">Insight</a>).
</p><p>The DC of a Deceive Check is the Insight Checks of all the people who are paying attention to you (The DM may decide to use Passive Insight instead of a Check).

</p><p>If your Deceive Check is higher than the contesting Insight Check, then the Deceive Check succeeds (meaning the person believes you are telling the truth). Otherwise it fails and they think you are lying (or think you aren’t who you appear if disguised).
</p><p>Deceive Checks are typically made once per conversation, if it is short. In the case of long term deceit such as a disguise, a Deceive Check is made every hour that someone is paying attention to the deceiver. Once the same person has been deceived by the same thing three consecutive times, Deceive checks are no longer necessary to actively deceive them. This is assuming there is no event that calls into question the truthfulness of the deceiver. For every such event, another Deceive check and corresponding Insight Checks should be made.
</p>

<h2 id="SocialSense">
<span>Social Sense(Cha)</span>
</h2>
<p><i>Your skill at navigating through a city, gathering information, and adapting to different social environments as well as your general social competence.</i>
</p><p>With high Social Sense, you adapt quickly to the customs of different groups of people, changing your mannerisms to make you more favorable in the eyes of those within the group. You are less likely to make a social blunder.
</p><p>You may make a Social Sense Check to figure out the customs or expectations of others through careful observation and intuition.

An animal is unlikely to go from Indifferent to Unfriendly without being influenced negatively towards you.

<span>Knowledge*</span>
</h2>
<p><i>The knowledge you’ve accumulated during your life, unique talents, and occupational skills.</i>
</p><p>Knowledge Skills (or Knowledges) work differently from other Skills. You can have multiple Knowledge Skills and each one is chosen by you, based on your character’s backstory and unique skills. At Level 1, every character gains 3 Knowledge Proficiencies for free (plus at least 2 more from Themes). You also gain an additional Knowledges equal to 1/3 your Intelligence Modifier, but don’t lose any Knowledges if this is negative.
</p><p>Knowledge Skills are not associated with an Ability Score.
</p><p>Each Knowledge can have up to 3 tiers with each tier getting progressively narrower. For instance, you could have a Knowledge that looked like this: Religion &#10132; The Atlean Pantheon &#10132; Pelor. When rolling for something that is second-tier (The Atlean Pantheon), you may roll twice and use the better result. When rolling for something that is third tier (Pelor), you may roll three times and use the better result. This tiered nature of Knowledge Skills represents how people tend to specialize in one area but still have some knowledge of related fields.
</p><p>The DM can approve or disapprove different Knowledges.
</p><p>When you become Proficient in a Knowledge Skill for the first time, you don’t gain a bonus to it, you simply are able to roll that Knowledge. Without Proficiency in a Knowledge, you cannot initiate a roll based on it. Alternatively, the DM may let you roll, but with a -10 to the Check. For each additional Proficiency you gain in a Knowledge Skill, you gain +5 to the Skill, up to +10 (with triple Proficiency in a Knowledge).
</p><p>When trying to determine if you know something with a Knowledge Check, the following are the guidelines for the DC: Basic knowledge is DC: 10, uncommon knowledge is DC: 15, niche knowledge is DC: 20, and obscure knowledge is DC: 25, and hidden knowledge is DC: 30.
</p><p>When trying to determine how well you craft an item, the following are the guidelines for the DC: Barely passable is DC: 10, decent quality is DC: 15, above average is DC: 20, expert quality is DC: 25, and masterwork is DC: 30.
</p><p>When trying to determine how well you perform, such as performing a piece of music, the following are the guidelines for the DC: Some noticeable mistakes is DC: 10, only a few mistakes is DC: 15, no noticeable mistakes is DC: 20, expert performance is DC: 25, and awe-inspiring performance is DC: 30.
