<p>When you want to accomplish certain tasks, you roll a Skill Check which determines you level of success.
</p><p><strong>Skill Check = 1d20 + Skill Bonus</strong>
</p><p>Your Skill Bonus determines your general ability at that Skill.
</p><p>Each Skill is associated with an Ability (Strength, Constitution, Dexterity, Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma). You add the relevant Ability Modifier to any Skill Check you make.
</p><p>You may become Proficient in skills by spending Background Points or taking certain Themes, Feats, and Combat Styles. A Skill Proficiency grants you a +4 bonus to a Skill. If you receive Proficiency for a Skill a second time for any reason you gain an additional +2 to that Skill. If you receive a third proficiency in the same Skill, you gain an additional +1 to that Skill (for a total Proficiency Bonus of +7). There is no benefit for having four or more Proficiencies in the same Skill.
</p><p>You add one third your Enhanced Wisdom Modifier to every skill. Wisdom skills such as Awareness, Heal, and Insight receive the normal Wisdom modifier plus this bonus. A negative wisdom modifier only applies to skills with which you are not proficient. 
</p><p>You start out with a number of Skill Ranks equal to their Intelligence Score. Each Skill Rank may be used to give +1 to a Skill (representing the study or practice of the Skill). You gain additional Skill Ranks per level equal to 4 + your Intelligence Modifier (even if it is negative). You may not put more Ranks in a Skill than the relevant Ability Modifier + your Level.
</p><p>Some Skills have an asterisk (*) next to them. This means two things: that Skill Ranks cannot be put into them unless you have Proficiency in the Skill and that you cannot instigate Checks in that Skill (though the DM may still have you roll a Check in the Skill).
</p><p><strong>Skill Bonus = relevant Ability Modifier + 1/3 Enhanced Wisdom Modifier + Proficiency Bonus + Skill Ranks + other bonuses</strong>

</p><p><strong>Breaking down a door or wall:</strong> As a general guideline, an old or poorly made wooden door is pretty easy to break down with a DC of around 20 while a thick stone door could be 50 or more. The check is made as a Standard Action and can be repeated several times. Charging into the structure by spending a Swift Action immediately before the Check to run at least 2m towards the door adds +5 to the Check. If the door/target is large enough, multiple people may be able to help on the check. In this case, only one d20 is rolled, but all character's UBS or LBS modifiers are added (if they are charging, the +5 bonuses also stack).
</p><p><strong>Lifting or pushing heavy objects:</strong> Checks usually don't have to be made to lift something heavy. It wouldn't make sense for you to be able to lift the chest yesterday but not today. DMs will decide what makes sense for you to be able to lift based off of your UBS.
</p><p><strong>Escape Hold:</strong> If you are Held by another creature, you may make an UBS or LBS check as a Standard Action with a DC of their UBS check to try to escape. If you are Held by something else, the DM will determine the DC for you to beat.

<p>Jumping especially high, moving through certain types of difficult terrain, kicking something far and/or accurately, running faster than normally allowed, etc.
</p><p><strong>Sprinting:</strong> When you Sprint, you spend a Standard Action to move your Speed and also spend 1 Energy and move an additional 2m, but may also make a Lower Body Strength Check to sprint further. With a roll of 20, you may move 1 extra meter, and for each 5 after that may move an additional 1m. <i>You should declare where you intend to sprint before the roll.</i> This way, you cannot change which direction you sprint based on your roll.
</p><p><strong>Jumping:</strong> When jumping, you may make a Lower Body Strength Check to see how far/high you can Jump. If you are getting a running start (requires a Sprint Action), you gain +2m to your Jump <em>Distance</em>.
</p><p><strong>Ignore Difficult Terrain:</strong> If you are proficient in LBS, you may sometimes spend an Instant Action to make a Lower Body Strength Check to attempt to ignore a certain amount of the difficult terrain. You are pushing through a hindrance, jumping over/around the hindrance, or nimbly avoiding the terrain obstacles.

</p><p>If you are trained in Swim, you have a base Swim Speed of 3m (difficult conditions can reduce this speed as seen below). While in the water, moving is a Full Round Action and depending on the conditions, you may be forced to roll a Swim Check. You may also willingly roll a Swim Check to try to increase your movement.

<p>Picking a lock also requires some object that can be used as a pick. Without this, picking a lock is impossible. However, a simple stick can count as this pick-like object. If you have tools made specifically for lock picking, they grant you +5 to your lock picking checks (possibly more if they are well made or magical).
</p><p>Lock picking is a Full Round Action. If you fail, then you may extend the amount of time you are working on the lock for another round and add +1 to you check. You may continue this for up to +10 to your Check. You can be interrupted from your attempt to break the lock, and continue at a later time, but your initial check for the lock holds until your next Extended Rest.

<h2 id="Stealth">
<span>Stealth(Dex)</span>
</h2>
<p>Used to hide from something or to move quietly and stay unnoticed.
</p><p><strong>Passive Stealth = Stealth bonus</strong>
</p><p>Your Passive Stealth applies all the time, even when you are not specifically trying to be stealthy. Theoretically, your Passive Stealth could be greater than another creature's Passive Awareness. In this case, unless you are trying to make noise, or they make a check, you will go undetected whether you are trying to or not.
</p><p>You may only try to hide or go undetected if the target is unable to see you for some reason (you may have cover, are camouflaged, or the target is facing away from you).
</p><p>You do not have to make a Stealth Check if you are hiding without moving. It is only once you DO something that you must make a Stealth Check.
</p><p>You have disadvantage on your Stealth Check if you are sprinting, climbing, jumping, swimming, or performing some other strenuous task.
</p><p>Stealth Checks don't take an action, but it may take an action to move to cover.

<h2 id="Appraise">
<span>Appraise(Int)</span>
</h2>
<p>Determining the value of an item. This includes how much an item is worth on the market but also encompasses determining what an item is capable of doing and what it is made for.

<h2 id="Craft">
<span>Craft(Int)*</span>
</h2>
<p>Used to pick locks and tamper with mechanical devices.
</p><p>The craft skill represents your knowledge of a particular craft and ability to implement that knowledge. It is always specified after the Craft skill what you are proficient at doing (eg: Craft(Woodworking)). 
</p><p>Some examples are Fletching/Bow-Making, Weapon Smithing, Armor Smithing, Farming, Cooking, Calligraphy, Pottery, Sewing/Cloth Making, Jewelry Making, Lock Making, Painting, Trap Making, and Shipbuilding. You can have multiple craft skills.
</p><p>When rolling for a craft skill you are Proficient in, if you roll below a 10, treat the roll as a 10 (this represents the consistent level of competency craftsman have).

<h2 id="Investigation">
<span>Investigation(Int)</span>
</h2>
<p>This is your attention to detail and ability to pick out important pieces of information and link them together to come to a conclusion. This is used to solve puzzles and interpret clues. Investigation may give insight to "what that lever does" or "where that tunnel leads." It is also used as a "find" skill when searching a room.
</p><p>Keep in mind that Investigation and Appraise may have a small amount of overlap when determining the purpose of an item.

<h2 id="Awareness">
<span>Awareness(Wis)</span>
</h2>
<p>Represents your alertness and ability to notice things that are suspicious or threatening. It opposes Stealth. As a general rule, use Investigation for the more specific situations of looking for things, and Awareness for the more broad situations of noticing things.
</p><p><strong>Passive Awareness = 10 + Awareness</strong>
</p><p>Passive Awareness determines what the DM will tell you without making Checks (this can be affected by Situational Modifiers, by where you're looking, and what you're focusing on). When making an Awareness Check, if the total is lower than your Passive Awareness, you treat the result as if it was your Passive Awareness.
</p><p>When you are asleep, your Passive Awareness is reduced by 10 (to just your Awareness). Awareness may be rolled in your sleep, but you will have negative Situational Modifiers.

<h2 id="Initiative">

<h2 id="Heal">
<span>Heal(Wis)</span>
</h2>
<p>Is used to give medical attention to a wounded creature. This can be done through non-magical means, but in this world, magic is an extension of your intention, so a healer who knows nothing of the arcane may still make heal checks without medical supplies. This is normal and all healers can use their Wisdom to give healing to others.

<h2 id="Insight">
<span>Insight(Wis)</span>
</h2>
<p>Social counterpart to Awareness. This is used to gauge intentions and sense the motives of other creatures.
</p><p><strong>Passive Insight = 10 + Insight</strong>
</p><p>Passive Insight determines what the DM will tell you without making Checks (this can be affected by situational modifiers). When making an Insight Check, if the total is lower than your Passive Awareness, you treat the result as if it was your Passive Insight.
</p><p>Insight can reveal how best to influence someone or even uncover their values and bonds.
</p><p>If you are making an insight check on an individual you've observed for some time, it will be easier for you to succeed on an Insight check. 
</p><p>Insight can be used on animals, but it is generally much more difficult than when used on people.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p>

<h2 id="Deceive">
<span>Deceive(Cha)</span>
</h2>
<p>Is used to act natural when telling a lie and when actively hiding the truth from someone. If you want to act convincingly like a person you are impersonating you must make a Deceive Check.
</p><p>The DC of a Deceive Check is the Insight Checks of all the people who are paying attention to you (The DM may decide to use Passive Insight instead of a Check). If you are avoiding telling the entire truth, but don't say a direct lie, add +5 to the deceive check. If what you are saying is far-fetched or would cause skepticism, then subtract -5 from the check. If what you are saying is absurd or impossible subtract -10 from the deceive check.
</p><p>If your Deceive Check is higher than the contesting Insight Check, then the Deceive Check succeeds (meaning the person completely believes you are telling the truth). Otherwise it fails.
</p><p>If the Deceive Check fails by...
</p><p><strong>less than 20: </strong>Something is suspicious about you. It is doubtful that you are telling the complete truth, but it can't be known for certain.
</p><p><strong>more than 20: </strong> You are exposed as being deceitful and seen as malicious. If you are hiding something it likely becomes evident.
</p><p>Deceive checks are typically made once per conversation (if it is short). In the case of long term deceit, a Deceive check is made every hour that someone is paying attention to the deceiver. Once the same person has been deceived by the same thing three consecutive times, Deceive checks are no longer necessary to actively deceive them. This is all assuming there is no event that calls into question the truthfulness of the deceiver. For every such event, another Deceive check and corresponding Insight Checks should be made.
</p><p>If your Deceive bonus is 15 or higher you do not have to roll for every conversation in which you are deceitful, but only if someone is suspicious of you.
</p><p>
</p>

<h2 id="Intimidate">
<span>Intimidate(Cha)</span>
</h2>
<p>Used to browbeat someone to do what you want and to frighten your opponents.
</p><p>Intimidation is a Charisma based skill because there are times when all it takes are a few well-placed words to make someone feel scared. However, there are also times when throwing a table across the room is intimidating, but has nothing to do with your Charisma. Thus, if appropriate, you can use your Strength Modifier instead of Charisma Modifier when making an Intimidate Check.
</p><p>You can attempt to intimidate a creature as a part of any action. However, to give the creature a disadvantage in combat, you must use a Swift Action to target a single creature. That creature makes a Will save with a DC of your Intimidate Score. If they fail, they are Shaken until the end of the next round.
</p><p>A failed Intimidate Check doesn't necessarily mean the target isn't scared (they can still be very afraid an act accordingly). It simply means they didn't do what the Intimidator wanted and/or they don't receive any combat disadvantages for being intimidated (they are not mechanically Shaken).

</p><p>
</p>

<h2 id="Inspire">
<span>Inspire(Cha)</span>
</h2>
<p>Used to encourage others to do something by appealing to their emotions, often through your passion. High Inspire Checks will make people want to act! You are appealing to people's hearts, not their reason. 
</p><p>It will help you make an impactful performance, whether with a musical instrument to move a crowd, an epic poem to impress the nobility, or a theater performance to make some coin. This skill determines the performance aspect of these things, not if you have musical talent or acting skill (which is determined by your Talent Proficiencies).

</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p>

<h2 id="Discourage">
<span>Discourage(Cha)</span>
</h2>
<p>Used to make people feel guilt, sadness, or sympathy. Discourage Checks tend to dampen spirits while Inspire Checks raise them.
</p><p>A Discourage Check can be made to provoke someone through insults, to make them feel sorry for you, or to make them feel guilty. 
</p><p>You can also use Discourage to make someone feel bad about themselves, sad, or unworthy.
</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> A character who can use both Discourage and Inspire can be quite powerful. They may make someone feel guilty before inspiring them to the right choice. They may make a crowd depressed before showing them the path to action! DMs should be aware that using two Charisma skills is more powerful than one!

<h2 id="Reason">
<span>Reason(Cha)</span>
</h2>
<p>The Reason skill is used to convince someone to do something by reasoning with them. Reason determines your skill at debating. It is often the best way to convince highly intelligent or cautious people to do something.
</p><p><strong>Changing Attitude:</strong> You may attempt to change a creature's attitude toward something by using Charisma skills such as Inspire, Discourage, Reason, or Intimidate. Some people are more easily swayed by certain approaches, but the following chart gives a general idea  of the difficulty of changing someone's attitude:

<p><strong>Asking for Something:</strong> The DC for persuading someone to help you out or do a favor for you is dependent on the situation. It is up to the DM to determine the DC for each situation.
</p><p>Some people are more responsive one method of persuasion than another. For instance, someone may be most swayed by Reason and resistant to Intimidation. Keep in mind that the type of person you are dealing with, their personality and their current mood can have a powerful effect on the DC of a Charisma based check.
</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Reason, Inspire, and Discourage checks become more difficult when dealing with low-intelligence creatures (say, an Intelligence Score of 6 or lower). In fact, against animals, these skills are no longer effective. (That would be within the purview of Animal Handling)

</p><p>
</p><p>
</p>

<h2 id="Acculturation">
<span>Acculturation(Cha)</span>
</h2>
<p>If you have high Acculturation, you adapt quickly to the customs of different groups of people. You learn their ways quickly and change your mannerisms accordingly. This will usually make you more favorable in the eyes of those within the culture, they will see you with less apprehension and more acceptance. You are less likely to make a social blunder.
</p><p>You may make an Accommodation check to navigate through a city or town, to quickly find a certain location in an urban setting, and to gather information from the locals. This skill represents your general social aptitude.
</p><p>Up to the DM's discretion, they may have you roll Accommodation for advice on what to say or do in a certain social situation. They may also warn you against certain actions automatically if this skill is high enough.
