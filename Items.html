<h2 id="CarryingItems">
<span>Carrying Items</span>
</h2>
<p>Figure out where you are going put all the weapons and other items you plan to travel with. You are only limited by what is reasonable for you to carry. Carrying around a couple of halberds would be difficult and quite uncomfortable unless you had a horse, cart, bag of holding, etc. It is ultimately up to the DM to determine what is reasonable for player characters to be able to carry.
</p>
    
<h2 id="UsingWeapons">
<span>Using Weapons</span>
</h2>
<p>The weapons listed are intended to be a representation of real weapons balanced for this game. But this should not limit your ability to role-play. For instance, if you would like to use a longsword, but prefer the stats of a scimitar, your character may wield a longsword which uses the in-game stats of a scimitar. Maybe your character wields a claymore that uses the stats of a greatsword or a katana which uses the stats of a longsword.
</p><p>If your MPL is lower than the MPR for a weapon you are using, you incur penalties when using the weapon. (see <a href="Combat.html#MPL">Martial Proficiency Level</a>)
</p>

<h2 id="WeaponEvasion">
<span>Weapon Evasion</span>
</h2>
<p>You can only use one weapon’s Evasion bonus at a time (meaning if you are wielding two weapons, you cannot gain the Evasion bonus from both). However, this rule does not apply to Light weapons. Thus, if you were wielding a mace and a dagger, you would gain the Evasion bonuses from both.
</p><p>Heavy weapons ignore the Evasion bonus of Light weapons.
</p><p><b>Note:</b> Shields do not count as weapons so you can gain the Evasion bonus from a shield and any other weapon you are using with it.
</p>

<h2 id="Reach">
<span>Reach</span>
</h2>
<p>Reach defines how many meters you can reach with a weapon or attack, and thus how much space is between you and your combatant.
</p>
<dl class="smallList">
<dt>Reach values follow this pattern:</dt>
    <dd>&#9671; <b>Reach0</b> is for weapons under half a meter or so in length. You can hit targets 1m away (adjacent to you).</dd>
    <dd>&#9671; <b>Reach1</b> is for weapons about a meter in length. You can hit targets up two 2m away (1 space in-between you).</dd>
    <dd>&#9671; <b>Reach2</b> is for weapons about 2 meters in length. You can hit targets 3 spaces away (2 spaces in-between you).</dd>
</dl>
<p>When a creature moves through your maximum Reach (and you are facing them), you may make a Swift Attack against them (Note that you can only make 1 Swift Attack each Round).
</p><p>When attacking a target standing closer than the maximum Reach of the weapon you’re attacking with, you have Disadvantage on your Combat roll. (The Versatile weapon property negates this Disadvantage)
</p><p class="pIndent"> <b>Note:</b> If two combatants with Reach 1 weapons are fighting each other, there will be one Space between them. This Space is not unoccupied &#8211; the combatants are constantly stepping in and out of that space to attack and defend. So, if the entire 1m of space between them is a pit, then they will likely be unable to attack each other with Reach1 weapons, as their weapons may only reach the edge of the Space on the other side. This also means no one can run in between them while they are engaged in combat. Always assume any attack at maximum Reach requires the attacker to step into the Space immediately in front of them.
</p>
<h2 id="WeaponProperties">
<span>Weapon Properties</span>
</h2>
<p>
</p>
<div class="hangingIndent">
<p>
</p><p><b>Brutal #: </b>If the weapon’s natural damage roll is # or lower, you re-roll the weapon damage until you get a number over the Brutal # and use that instead. If the Brutal # is as high as any number that the damage die can roll, then the highest possible outcome of the damage die is used. Brutal only applies the weapon’s base damage roll.
</p><p><b>Precise #: </b>The weapon’s Critical Hit range is increased by #.
</p><p><b>Devastate #: </b>This weapon deals double damage to shields and if a natural 20 is rolled on the Combat roll, the target’s armor is Broken (or Shield if that's what was being targeted). If there is a # after Devastate, it this weapon also has a chance to ignore some of the target’s armor. If the weapon’s natural damage roll is the # or higher, the attack ignores half the AR of the target’s armor (rounding the amount ignored up).
</p><p><b>Exposing #: </b>When attacking with this weapon, you Expose yourself on Combat roll and Hit rolls # higher than you otherwise would (or # less than you normally would if there is a minus sign before the #). Note you are always Exposed when you roll a natural 1 on a Combat roll.
</p><p><b>Versatile: </b>When you attack something with this weapon which is closer than the maximum Reach of the weapon, you do not have Disadvantage on your Combat roll. If there are parentheses after Versatile, it means the weapon can be used both 1-handed and 2-handed and the die in the parentheses is the damage the weapon deals when wielded 2-handed. When used as a two-handed weapon, all Versatile weapons gain +1 Evasion.
</p><p><b>Two-Handed: </b>The weapon requires two hands to wield.
</p><p><b>Brace: </b>When you hit a creature with this weapon during a Swift Attack as they cross your maximum Reach, their movement is stopped and they do not get past your maximum Reach. They also lose 1 Energy.
</p><p><b>Trip: </b>When you perform the Trip Combat Maneuver with this weapon, you may deal damage on the attack.
</p><p><b>Disarm: </b>When you perform the Disarm Combat Maneuver with this weapon, you may deal damage on the attack.
</p><p><b>Thrown(#/#/#): </b>This item can be thrown as a ranged attack without dealing half damage and has Accuracy equal to its AV bonus. The 3 numbers in parenthesis are typical ranged values indicating Advantage and Disadvantage on the Hit roll. For example: Thrown(5/10/20) would mean if the target is 5m or closer, you have Advantage on the Hit roll; if the target is over 10m away, you have Disadvantage on your Hit roll; and 20m is the maximum range the weapon can be thrown in which you can hope to be accurate. (see <a href="Skills.html#UBS">UBS</a>)
</p><p><b>Draw Weight: </b>This weapon’s range and damage can be increased based on the Draw Weight table. (see <a href="Combat.html#DrawWeight">Draw Weight</a>)
</p><p><b>Loading: </b>This weapon takes some amount of time to load and it requires ammunition (bolt, arrow, dart, rock, etc.). If the weapon is Two-Handed, you must load it with no shield, weapon, or other item in your hands besides the weapon and its ammunition. If the weapon is one-handed, you may load it while one of your hands holds a Light weapon, Light shield, or a small item which would no more than slightly hinder the loading process. You are Exposed while loading. If Loading requires 3 or more Energy, you are Unguarded while Loading, and cannot Agile Move.
</p><p><b>Light: </b>This weapon’s Evasion bonus may be used even if you are wielding another weapon, but does not help you defend against Heavy weapons.
</p><p><b>Heavy: </b>Attacks with this weapon ignore the Evasion bonus of Light weapons and Light shields.

If your attack is higher than their Evasion not including the shield, then you hit the shield and deal damage to its Durability equal to your damage minus the shield’s Hardness.

<dt>Notes:</dt>
    <dd>&#9671; <b>Full Plate &amp; Dwarven Plate:</b> You have Disadvantage on Awareness when your visor is down. However, if your visor isn’t down, your armor just has an AC of 18 instead of complete coverage.</dd>
    <dd>&#9671; <b>Dwarven Plate &amp; Dwarven Segmented Plate:</b><i class="flavorText"> This armor is always made with hardened materials and expert craftmanship making it harder to break.</i> When your armor would be Broken by a weapon attack, roll a 1d6. If the roll is 5 or higher, the armor is not Broken.</dd>
</dl>

<h2 id="BrokenArmor&Shields">
<span>Broken Armor &amp; Shields</span>
</h2>
<p>One’s armor or shield can be broken in a variety of ways, but being hit with an attack from a Devastating weapon with a natural 20 on the Combat roll is one of the most common ones. These weapons are designed to shatter shields and rend armor and a good hit will do just that.
</p><p>Broken armor provides only half the Armor Rating it normally provides (rounding down). Note that if you are wearing multiple sets or armor (for instance regular armor and under-armor) and your armor is Broken, only one set may actually break, but you suffer a halved total AR regardless.
</p><p>Broken shields provide none of their Evasion bonus.
</p><p>During a Short Rest, someone who is very familiar with the type of armor or shield that is broken may spend 15 minutes repairing it enough to be considered not Broken and it will give its full bonuses again. 
</p><p>Depending on the way the item was broken and the amount of damage it sustained, the DM may rule that the tools and skills of a blacksmith (or someone proficient in Craft(armor)) is required to fix the item.
</p><p><b>Note:</b> If you break armor in an attack, you may consider it Broken for the purposes of that very attack.
