</p><p>High elves are strong in mind and spirit. They value knowledge of the world and often form deep, spiritual connections with either a certain geographical area, or the life of the world as a whole. While becoming physically mature around the same age as humans, high elves can live until they are 7 or 8 hundred years old, and often consider themselves adults around the age of 100, though this is a personal decision and each elf reaches this stage at varying times.
</p><p>High elf culture is collectivist with a high value placed on relational status and respect for those above you. Many humans are baffled by the slowness of high elves who spend time to ponder each decision and its future impact, while the elves view humans as rash and spiritually immature. High elves form strong relational bonds with one another to the point that, over the course of perhaps hundreds of years, they can communicate with but a glance. Much goes more occurs underneath the surface of high elven interaction than what meets the eye.

</p><p>Long ago, the dark elves were banished to the subterranean caverns that pervade the crust of the earth. Quick to adapt, these elves became the most powerful force in the underdark and now rule over large portions of it.
</p><p>Dark elf culture values strength, power, and achievement by any means and to meet ambitions both individually and as a society. Dark elves are isolationists, preferring to immerse themselves in their own dark world of art, war, and intrigue. While rare, when a dark elf lives on the surface, they are distrusted or even persecuted by other races, especially other elves.
</p><p>Dark elves are sensitive to bright light, and avoid the outside on a cloudless day. Thus, you have Disadvantage on all Skill Checks when in bright light. However, if accustomed to surface living, this Disadvantage only applies for the first minute after entering into bright light.

</p><p>Wood elves live in communities contained within the forests spread across the world. These elves live harmoniously with the woodland creatures in their territory and are one with the forests they protect. Many are powerful hunters, trained survivalists, and healers all in one. 
</p><p>Wood elves have strong collectivist values, helping one another and bearing responsibility for their family and friends. They care strongly for their family and their tribe. To other races, wood elves appear anti-social and solitary, though they can be quite lively at wood elf festivals.

</p><p>Dwarves live to be about 3 or 4 hundred years old, reach adulthood around age 30, and are physically hardy for the entirety of their lives, not losing strength until their final few days. They pride themselves as a strong and lawful race. They get along fairly well with humans and halflings, but they typically dislike elves.
</p><p>Dwarven culture promotes personal strength, success, and drive to rise above. From their race comes the most skilled smiths, stone and gemstone artisans, and warriors that are remembered by all races.
</p><p>There are many tribes of Dwarves, but most are loyal to the Dwarven King.

</p><p>Halflings are practical creatures who tend to distance themselves from conflict. Because of their amiable nature and trustworthiness, halflings are well liked by every other race. Known for their resourcefulness and ability to find solutions to problems, halflings may make good advisors and diplomats. Halflings however are not ambitious, preferring to live a simple life without the arrogance of those with wealth or the greed of those aspiring to gain it. Some halflings have a penchant for adventure, exploring to the far corners of the earth.

</p><p>Tieflings have the blood of demons and fiends coursing through their veins. Every tiefling has a different appearance. One might possess ram horns, a reptilian tail, and long claw-like fingernails. Another might have short horns, sharp fangs, and small black wings. Their appearance can be traced back to their demon ancestor, but even among tieflings with the same progenitor their physical features may differ widely.
</p><p>Most tieflings do not have any personal relationship with the demon who started their bloodline. It may have started dozens of generations ago, and it isn’t uncommon for it to skip generations, meaning a tiefling could be born to human parents unaware of their tainted bloodline.
</p><p>Tieflings are found in many human populations, often on the fringes of society, marginalized or shunned by fear. They do not often congregate or make their own communities as they all come from different backgrounds and their diverse ideals combined with their propensity for hostility prevents such unions from lasting.
</p><p>A tiefling’s lifespan is bit over 100 years and they mature slightly quicker than humans in their youth.

</p><p>Gnomes live about as long as elves (6-8 hundred years) but age faster. They become adults around age 20 and for a few hundred years remain strong and spry, but about half way through their life span gnomes show signs of aging-their hair turns white and they eventually grow week and wrinkled.

</p><p>Dragonborn lay eggs anywhere from 2-5 at a time, but female dragonborn only become fertile every few years. The eggs have a hard, scaled surface that protects the young dragonborn as they grow for about a year. At this point, they may hatch if the conditions are right, but some eggs don’t hatch until almost another year later. Dragonborn grow quickly, becoming adults at age 10 and living up to 80 years old.
</p><p>In dragonborn clans children are raised communally and taught the values of the clan through story and discipline. They learn clan pride, respect for their elders, and understanding that their actions reflect upon not just themselves, but their clan or even race as a whole. Most young dragonborn also are shown the importance of responsibility and integrity.
</p><p>Dragonborn are sensitive to good and evil in the world and conscious of their roll involving one side or another.
