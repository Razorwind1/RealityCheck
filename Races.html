<p>High elves are strong in mind and spirit. They value knowledge of the world and often form deep, spiritual connections with a certain geographical area or certain life forms. While becoming physically mature around the same age as humans, high elves can live until they are 7 or 8 hundred years old, and often consider themselves adults around the age of 100, though this is a personal decision and each elf reaches this stage at varying times.
</p><p>High elf culture is collectivist with a high value placed on relational status and respect for those above you. Many humans are baffled by the slowness of high elves who spend time to ponder each decision and its future impact, while the elves view humans as rash and spiritually immature. High elves form strong relational bonds with one another to the point that, over the course of perhaps hundreds of years, they can communicate with but a glance. Much goes on, unnoticed by foreigners, below the surface of elven interaction.

<p>Tieflings have the blood of demons and fiends coursing through their veins. Every tiefling has a different appearance. One might possess ram horns, a reptilian tail, and long claw-like fingernails. Another might have short horns, sharp fangs, and small black wings. Their appearance can be traced back to their demon ancestor, but even among tieflings with the same progenitor their physical features may differ widely.
</p><p>Most tieflings do not have any personal relationship with the demon who started their bloodline. It may have started dozens of generations ago, and it isn’t uncommon for it to skip generations, meaning a tiefling could be born to human parents unaware of their tainted bloodline.
</p><p>Tieflings are found in many human populations, often on the fringes of society, marginalized or shunned by fear. They do not often congregate or make their own communities as they all come from different backgrounds and their diverse ideals combined with their propensity for hostility prevents such unions from lasting.
</p><p>A tiefling’s lifespan is bit over 100 years and they mature slightly quicker than humans in their youth.

<p>There are two types of Vampire races which are clearly related, but also clearly distinct:
</p><p><u>Vampire Nobles</u> are feared for their social intrigue as much as their physical prowess, the vampire nobles are known for their cunning, pride, and ambition. While they could pass fairly easily as a human, with only their fangs and more angular features giving them away, most would never stoop so low. 
</p><p><u>Feral Vampires</u> are known as the vampires of shadows, feral vampires hate sunlight and are the terrors of the night. Unlike the vampire nobles, they are unrefined and allow their primal instincts to guide their actions and give them power. These vampires look dark, drawn, and gaunt.
</p><p>You may decide how these two types of vampires interact in your world. Perhaps they work together with the nobles being the political leaders and the ferals being the enforcers and assassins. Or, perhaps they despise each other and are constantly working to thwart the other’s objectives.
</p><p>Vampires will not die of old age and are immune to many natural diseases. Vampires do not appear to age beyond the point of about 30 years old in human terms. However, drinking blood stalls aging to that point, so many vampires appear to age very, very slowly, if at all, remaining at whatever appearance of age they desire for hundreds of years.
</p><p>Given all these things, vampires are generally hated by most other races.
</p><p>

</p><p><strong>Size:</strong> Medium
</p><p><strong>Speed:</strong> 7m
</p><p>You have Weakness to Light.
</p><p>If not wearing armor or using a shield, you gain +2 Evasion.
</p>
<p><u><i>Thirst For Blood</i></u>
</p><p>Vampires crave the blood of other creatures. They find it delicious and satisfying. The longer they go without blood, the more intense this craving becomes.
</p><p>For every 3 days a vampire goes without drinking a few ounces of blood, their max Stamina is reduced by 1 every day until it is at 3 max Stamina. During this time, the vampire physically degrades as its skin pales and body shrivels, and mentally they become more and more focused on the near irresistible thirst for blood. If a vampire is deprived of blood for an even longer amount of time, other negative effects may manifest themselves. The DM may modify the exact ramifications of a vampire not drinking blood.
</p><p><b>Note:</b> Vampires find the blood of animals and non-humanoid creatures unappetizing and gross tasting, but it may be used as a last resort. Though not as effective as human blood, vampires have survived years on animal blood.
</p><p><u><i>Blood is Life</i></u>
</p><p>When the fangs of a vampire touch another’s aura it is weekend in that spot, allowing them to briefly piece through an aura and drink a small amount of blood. When a vampire drinks the blood of another creature, it regains 4 Stamina and 2 Aura. A vampire cannot gain this benefit from the same creature more than once per Long Rest. When not used as a part of another ability, it takes 2 Energy to drink enough blood to gain this benefit.
</p><p><u><i>Fang Attack</i></u>
</p><p>You can make an attack with your fangs which deals no damage, but allows you to use your Blood is Life ability. You may make a melee attack against an adjacent creature whose blood is easily accessible (bare skin or easily penetrable cloth). You are Exposed. The attack has an AV of 15 + MASAB + 1/3 Level. If you hit, you may make use of your Blood is Life ability (for no additional Energy cost). If the target of the attack is Exposed, you are not automatically Exposed during the attack and have Advantage on your Combat roll.

<h4>More on Vampires</h4>
<p><u><i>Spreading</i></u>
</p><p>True vampires almost never voluntarily spread their “gift” to others. They typically think others are undeserving of being vampires and don’t want the competition of another vampire. However, on the rare occasion a vampire deems someone worthy of becoming one, all the target must do is drink about 2 ounces (1/4 cup) of the vampire’s blood (within a short amount of time). Then they undergo about a day of painful transformation in which they lose whatever racial bonuses they had in exchange for the vampire’s racial bonuses. They become the type of vampire that the blood they drank was from. Once a true vampire, there is no known way of going back. (the DM may allow traits of the old race to be kept instead of gaining some vampire traits)
</p><p><u><i>Vampirism Disease</i></u>
</p><p>Many different creatures may become infected with vampirism, humans included. A human infected with vampirism has a constant, powerful thirst for blood. If they go without blood for 5 days, they suffer physical pain, and after 10 days without another creature’s blood, they die. Once they drink another creature’s blood, they appear more youthful, but before the day is through begin to look drawn and starved. 
</p><p>They have Weakness to Light and gain the Loath the Sun ability from the Feral Vampire. These vampires are technically undead but they still have complete control over their actions. They hate garlic and have Weakness to silver weapons.
</p><p>Vampirism has several benefits. The afflicted gains +1 Speed, Heat Vision, and the vampire’s Blood is Life and Fang Attack abilities. Additionally, they count as vampires for the purpose of learning spells and taking feats or themes. They will not die of old age as long as they consume enough blood, and can retain youthful appearances also by consuming large amounts of blood.
</p><p>Vampirism is a curable disease, but is magic resistant. A purify spell would be able to cure it, but the DC would be higher than normal.
</p><p>The vampirism disease can be spread through blood like any other blood-borne disease. Creatures with vampirism usually don’t care about spreading or containing the disease.
