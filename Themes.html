<p>Much of your defining knowledge and expertise come from Themes—you can think of them like mega-feats. After gaining 2 Themes at Level 1, of which one must not be a Combat Theme, you gain 1 Theme every 5 Levels.
</p><p>If a Theme grants you a Feat, you gain it regardless of its Tier. You still cannot gain the same feat twice. If a Theme grants you a feat which you already have, or cannot acquire for some other reason, then you may gain one Feat of your choice of a lower Tier instead.
</p><p>When you gain a Theme, you also gain 1 Knowledge Proficiency which pertains to the Theme.
</p><p>Currently, Themes are divided into several groups: Martial Themes, Magic Themes, Practices, and Devine Pledges. All Marital Themes and some Magic Themes and Devine Pledges are Combat Themes.
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>[Note: Since the game is still in development, many themes are lacking ability names and flavor text.]
