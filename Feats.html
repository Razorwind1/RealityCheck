<p>Feats have 5 tiers:
</p>
<ul class="pList">
    <li>0 = Background</li>
    <li>1 = Levels 1-4</li>
    <li>2 = Levels 5-9</li>
    <li>3 = Levels 10-14</li>
    <li>4 = Levels 15-20</li>
</ul>
<p>Background Feats may be taken using Background Points during character creation. At each Tier, all previous feats are also available.
</p><p>For example, at level 9, you have access to Background Feats, Tier 1 Feats, and Tier 2 Feats.
</p><p>At each level, a single Feat may be swapped out for another of its tier or lower (one must still maintain the minimum number of non-combat feats based on their Level).
</p><p>You cannot gain the same feat twice! (unless otherwise specified) 
</p><p>Every third Level, you must have an additional Non-Combat Feat. This is intended to balance your character and give more flavor than having all purely combat-based abilities.

        The DM makes a secret roll with a 50% chance of failure. If the role succeeds, then the DM answers in a such a way that the feeling you receive matches the likely outcome of your question. If the roll fails, the DM may gives an answer which does not match the likely outcome of your question. The DM may also choose to give a degree of the feeling you receive, such as “you have a very strong bad feeling about it” or “you feel somewhat good about it.” Once you use your Intuition ability on something, the feelings you get about it from your Intuition ability cannot change until you take a Long Rest.
