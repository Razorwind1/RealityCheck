<p>This game promotes complete roleplaying freedom and thus there are no classes which are commonly found in other games. Instead, you can choose from a wide range of options to develop your own unique character! While your choice of Feats and themes are important in defining your character, the best role-playing experience comes from a character with depth—one who has personality and builds close relationships with those around them.
</p>
<h2>
<span>Level 1</span>
</h2>
<p>Each character gains certain benefits because of their race (see <a href="Races.html">Races</a>).
</p><p>Every character at Level one starts out with 2 Themes (one must not be a Combat Theme), 1 Feat, 14 Background Points, Proficiency in 1 Charisma based Skill, 3 Knowledge Proficiencies, and one Language.
</p><p>Every character is also required to have at least one Defining Statement and one Trouble.
</p><p>You must also determine your character’s Ability Scores at Level 1.
</p>

<h2 id="CharacterConcept">
<span>Character Concept</span>
</h2>
<p>What is your character like? This question is always considered when creating a character, but is also important to ask throughout your time playing them. Because the characters we make up are abstract and only exist in the collective fantasy of the group, I find it helpful to view playing a character as both an effort to play them a certain way and a discovery of what the character is really like as they react to situations.
</p><p>Personality is a great place to start when building a character. Are they extroverted, cautious, stern, companionate, or impulsive? You can also start with their backstory and motivation. What is their family like? Why are they traveling in a party? What do they despise?
</p><p>You can get inspiration for your character anywhere, but here are a few things you might want to consider, which may help you decide who you want to play:
</p>
<dl class="smallList">
    <dd>&#9671; What is your education Level? This will affect the kind of language you use.</dd>
    <dd>&#9671; What is your general attitude? Are you generally amiable or sullen? Gullible or suspicious?</dd>
    <dd>&#9671; How might you interact with your companions? Are you eager to help, out to prove yourself, socially awkward, well-meaning but clumsy, longing for attention, a teacher, a bully?</dd>
    <dd>&#9671; What harmless quirks or ticks does your character have? A slight stammer, tapping finger, stroking mustache, repeating a phrase, tagging a word at the end of sentences, snorting laughter, cleaning dagger, whittling, smoking, biting nails, twirling hair, frequent drooling, jingling purse, clapping hands?</dd>
</dl>
<p>
</p><p>Every character is required to have at least one Defining Statement and one Trouble. However, multiple of each are encouraged. Troubles can lead to very fun role-playing experiences. Note that even each Defining Statement below could get the character into some trouble.
</p>
<h4>
<span>Defining Statements</span>
</h4>
<p><i>A phrase that describes your character.</i>
</p>
<dl class="smallList">
<dt>Examples of Defining Statements:</dt>
    <dd>&#9671; Alisa, the daring Halfling captain of the Sunwave Galley is always eager to put on a show!</dd>
    <dd>&#9671; “I never back down from a fight when someone weaker than me needs protecting!”</dd>
    <dd>&#9671; Robbed of family and home, Erwin tames an insatiable thirst for the blood of evildoers.</dd>
    <dd>&#9671; “The future doesn’t wait for those who dally!”</dd>
</dl>

<h4>
<span>Troubles</span>
</h4>
<p><i>A phrase that describes a difficulty your character faces.</i>
</p>
<dl class="smallList">
<dt>Examples of Troubles:</dt>
    <dd>&#9671; “It doesn’t take much for me to lose my temper.”</dd>
    <dd>&#9671; “The Sicilio Vanguard wants my head on a pike.”</dd>
    <dd>&#9671; “I have to take care of my sickly sister.”</dd>
    <dd>&#9671; “Ever since the curse, my vision clouds beyond my outstretched arm.”</dd>
</dl>

<h2 id="AbilityScores">
<span>Ability Scores</span>
</h2>
<p> A character’s Ability Scores represents their strengths and weaknesses in certain areas.
</p>
<p>When creating a character, you may roll for stats or use the point buy system. Every third Level, you may increase two of your ability scores by 1. No player character's Ability Score can be increased above 20 in any way.
</p><p><strong class="big">Strength</strong> represents how physically strong, fast, and fit a character is. A strong character may be brawny or sinewy.
</p><p><strong class="big">Constitution</strong> represents how healthy a character is, their body's resistance to stress and disease, and their general Level of energy and stamina. A character with low constitution may be seen as frail, tired, or sickly.
</p><p><strong class="big">Dexterity</strong> represents the physical skill of a character including their hand-eye coordination, sense of balance, and ability to move smoothly. Dexterity is a bodily know-how.
</p><p><strong class="big">Intelligence</strong> represents the accumulated knowledge of a character, their ability to retain information, and capacity to use their knowledge to come to logical conclusions.
</p><p><strong class="big">Wisdom</strong> represents a character's instinctive and intuitive sense of how the world works, their mindfulness, and their knack for making good decisions. Wisdom generally increases with age as more life experience is gained and the capriciousness of youth is cast off.
</p><p><strong class="big">Charisma</strong> represents a character's communication skills and thus their ability to convey their thoughts in an effective way and control the outcome of an interaction.
</p><p>Note that an Ability Score of 8-12 represents the typical or ordinary skill Level of humans. Though someone who loves to learn and studied in higher education for years would be expected to have an Intelligence of 14-18 and similarly, someone who loves wrestling and has done body building for years would be expected to have a Strength of 14-18. Those with a score of 19 or 20 are usually in the top of their field. Those with a score of 5-7 would stand out as deficient and anyone with a score of 4 or lower is considered handicapped.
</p><p>With regards to Intelligence, animals typically have 0-2, semi-sentient creatures typically have 4-5, and sentient creatures typically have 7 or above. However, Intelligence is not the sole determinant of sentience.
</p>

<h4 id="DeterminingAbilityScores">
<span>Determining your Ability Scores</span>
</h4>
<p>When creating a character, you may roll for Ability Scores or use the point-buy system. Your Ability Scores are also affected by your Race. Every third Level, you may increase two of your Ability Scores by 1. No Ability Score may be increased above 20 in this way.
</p><p>When determining your character’s Ability Scores, you may either roll for them, or use the point-buy system.
</p>

<h4 id="RollingAbilityScores">

<p>Roll an 8-sided die 6 times. Add 6 to each of the results and distribute the results as you wish among your Ability Scores.

<p>You may also give your character certain disadvantages that give you extra Background Points. You must have a rational explaining why your character has this penalty (for instance, if you have Disadvantage on Slight of Hand Checks, it might be because you are missing several fingers, and if you have -1 Will it might be because you are easily distracted). It’s a good idea to choose your disadvantages based on your Troubles. Your DM may approve other options for gaining Background Points.

At least 1/3 of your Feats gained this way must be Non-Combat Feats (1 by Level 3, 2 by Level 7, 3 by Level 11, 4 by Level 14, and 5 by Level 18). Note that no Feats gained through other means such as through your Race, a Theme, or by spending Background Points affect this requirement.
</p><p>Every time you gain a Level, you may swap a single Feat you gained through Level progression (not from your Race, Themes, etc.) with another of its Tier or lower. You must still adhere to any Feat requirements you have, such as the minimum number of Non-Combat Feats.
