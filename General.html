<h2 id="Rules">
<span>General Rules</span>
</h2>
<p>Always round down!</p>


<h2 id="AbilityScores">
<span>Ability Scores</span>
</h2>
<p> A character's Ability Scores represents their strengths and weaknesses in certain areas.
</p>
<p>When creating a character, you may roll for stats or use the point buy system (<a href="something.html">see Character Creation</a>). Every third level, you may increase two of your ability scores by 1. No ability score can be increased above 20 in any way.
</p><p><strong class="big">Strength</strong> represents how physically strong, fast, and fit a character is. A strong character may be brawny or sinewy.
</p><p><strong class="big">Constitution</strong> represents how healthy a character is, their body's resistance to stress and disease, and their general level of energy and stamina. A character with low constitution may be seen as frail, tired, or sickly.
</p><p><strong class="big">Dexterity</strong> represents the physical skill of a character including their hand-eye coordination, sense of balance, and ability to move smoothly. Dexterity is a bodily know-how.
</p><p><strong class="big">Intelligence</strong> represents the accumulated knowledge of a character, their ability to retain information, and capacity to use their knowledge to come to logical conclusions.
</p><p><strong class="big">Wisdom</strong> represents a character's instinctive and intuitive sense of how the world works, their mindfulness, and their knack for making good decisions. Wisdom generally increases with age as more life experience is gained and the capriciousness of youth is cast off.
</p><p><strong class="big">Charisma</strong> represents a character's communication skills and thus their ability to convey their thoughts in an effective way and control the outcome of an interaction.
</p>

<h2 id="Terminology">
<span>Terminology</span>
</h2>
<p>In the rules there is a lot of special terminology. To make things easier to understand, here is a list of terms and what they mean:</p>
<p><small>(Use the hotkey ctr+f to quickly FIND the term you are looking for)</small></p>

<dl>
	<dt>Dungeon Master (DM)</dt>
		<dd>The Dungeon Master is the leader of the game. They describe the world and what happens when a player attempts to do something. They control everything except for the player's characters. Any rules may be overwritten or altered by the DM.</dd>
	<dt>Difficulty Class (DC)</dt>
		<dd>Difficulty Class is a number that must be met or exceeded for a task to succeed. For instance, if you are trying to trick a troll into letting you across its bridge, there would be a DC (decided by the DM) which you would have to beat with your Deceive or Reason Check. If you are trying to deactivate a ticking bomb, your Disable Device Check must be higher than the DC for you to stop it from exploding.</dd>
	<dt>Advantage/Disadvantage</dt>
		<dd>When you have advantage on a roll it means you roll the die twice and take the higher result. Disadvantage means you roll twice and take the lower result.If you have both advantage and disadvantage, they cancel each other out so you only roll once. You cannot benefit from multiple advantages in which you roll 3 or more times and take the best result (the same goes for having multiple disadvantages). However, multiple advantages can still be useful if you have disadvantages as well. For instance, if you have 2 sources of advantage and 1 source of disadvantage, you would roll with advantage. <br>
		You may willingly give up advantage.</dd>
	<dt>Ability Score</dt>
		<dd>You have 6 ability scores: Strength, Constitution, Dexterity, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. These represent your character's general aptitude in different physical and mental areas.</dd>
	<dt>Ability Modifier <span> = (Enhanced Ability Modifier)/2 or (Ability Score - 10)/2</span></dt>
		<dd>
		This is a common number used in calculations.</dd>
	<dt>Enhanced Ability Modifier <span> = Ability Score-10</span></dt>
		<dd>
		This is a common number used in calculations.</dd>
	<dt>Skill Bonus <span> = relevant Ability Modifier + 1/3 Enhanced Wisdom Modifier + Proficiency Bonus + Skill Ranks + other bonuses</span></dt>
		<dd>
		This determines your general aptitude at a certain skill. It is calculated by adding together the Ability Modifier associated with that skill, any Proficiency bonus you may have for that skill, any Skill Ranks you have put into that skill, and 1/3 your Enhanced Wisdom Modifier. Other bonuses from your race or feats or themes may also apply.</dd>
	<dt>Skill Check <span> = 1d20 + Skill Bonus</span></dt>
		<dd>
		Determines how well you perform an action related to a particular skill. To make a skill check roll 1d20 and add your Skill Bonus.</dd>
	<dt>Knowledge Bonus <span> = Intelligence Modifier + Proficiency Bonus + other bonuses</span></dt>
		<dd>
		Determines how much you know about a certain subject and perhaps also how well you perform a task implementing that knowledge. Note that Knowledge Proficiencies give a +7 bonus (instead of +4) and subsequent proficiencies in the same skill give an additional +7 bonus.</dd>
	<dt>Knowledge Check <span> = 1d20 + Knowledge Bonus</span></dt>
		<dd>
		Determines how much you know about a certain subject and perhaps also how well you perform a task implementing that knowledge.</dd>
	<dt>Talent Proficiency</dt>
		<dd>Something your character does very well that is not a skill or knowledge such as playing a lute, juggling, or playing hearts. You do not need to roll checks to do something covered by your Talent Proficiencies. (<a href="something.html">Talent Proficiencies</a>)</dd>
	<dt>Standard Action</dt>
		<dd>An action that takes 4 energy and about 2 seconds to perform. (<a href="something.html">Actions</a>)</dd>
	<dt>Swift Action</dt>
		<dd>An action that takes 2 energy and about 1 second to perform. (<a href="something.html">Actions</a>)</dd>
	<dt>Instant Action</dt>
		<dd>An action that takes 2 energy and about half a second to perform. (<a href="something.html">Actions</a>)</dd>
	<dt>Energy</dt>
		<dd>Energy is required to perform actions. Without energy you cannot move, and with a lot of it you can do things faster. When in combat you gain 7 Energy every round (about 3.5 seconds) to spend on performing actions. (<a href="something.html">Energy</a>)</dd>
	<dt>Stamina</dt>
		<dd>Allows you to perform more actions in a shorter period of time. You can convert Stamina to Energy at a 1 to 1 ratio, but only once per round. This means in a fight you may spend the first few rounds by using your Stamina to perform extra actions, but eventually tire and fight slower.<br>
		Your Stamina level also determines how much Energy you get each round. If it is 7 or above, you gain 7 Energy each round, but if it is lower you gain Energy each round equal to your Stamina. (<a href="something.html">Stamina</a>)
		</dd>
	<dt>Fortitude<span> = 1/3 Level + Constitution Modifier + Strength Modifier + bonuses </span></dt>
		<dd>Your ability to endure some negative physical effects.(<a href="something.html">Fortitude</a>)
		</dd>
	<dt>Fortitude Save<span> = 1d10 + Fortitude</span></dt>
		<dd>Determines how well you can resist a certain negative physical effect.(<a href="something.html">Fortitude</a>)
		</dd>
	<dt>Will<span> = 1/3 Level + Charisma Modifier + Wisdom Modifier + bonuses </span></dt>
		<dd>Your determination and willpower which protects against mental and some physical attacks.(<a href="something.html">Will</a>)
		</dd>
	<dt>Will Save<span> = 1d10 + Will</span></dt>
		<dd>Determines how well you can resist a certain negative mental effect.(<a href="something.html">Will</a>)
		</dd>
	<dt>Chance Roll<span> = 1d20</span></dt>
		<dd>This is a roll of pure luck. By default, a 1-9 is a fail, and a 10-20 is a success. This may also be referred to as a Chance Save.(<a href="something.html">Chance Roll</a>)
		</dd>
	<dt>Martial Proficiency Level (MPL)</dt>
		<dd>Represents a character's martial ability - their general skill in the field of battle and use of weapons. MPL determines which weapon combinations you can wield effectively (which Combat Proficiencies you can have). You also gain +1 UBS, LBS, or Initiative for each level. (<a href="something.html">Martial Proficiency Level</a>)</dd>

	<dt>Target</dt>
		<dd>Sometimes the rules will refer to the "target" of an ability or effect. In this case, the target is whatever the ability is attempting to affect.</dd>
	<dt>Creature</dt>
		<dd>Many abilities will target a creature. Some of these abilities may work on non-creature targets such as inanimate objects. It is up to the DM to decide what makes sense and which of these abilities can exclusively be used on creatures.</dd>
